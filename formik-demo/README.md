# Formik Demo

Formik is a library that makes it really easy to work with forms in React.

## Why Do We Need It?

React does provide necessary tags to create form and other relevant elements, but they are verbose and hard to work with, especially when we have a lot of forms in our application.

## How Is It Better Than Redux Form?

Redux form stores form data in global Redux store, but it makes more sense to store them in component local state.
