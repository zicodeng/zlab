# WebGL (Web Graphics Library)

## What Is WebGL?

Built on top of OpenGL, WebGL is a browser-based JavaScript API that allows us to directly communicate with GPU for drawing 3D graphics and applying visual effects.

## Concepts

### Vertex

### Shader

A shader is a program, written in **OpenGL ES Shading Language (GLSL)**, that is responsible for positioning and coloring pixels.

A shader program is typically a set of vertex shaders and the fragment shaders.

-   **Vertex Shader**: transform the vertices of a triangle from a local model coordinate system to the screen position.
-   **Fragment Shader**: compute the color of a pixel within a triangle rasterized on screen.
